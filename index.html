					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey everyone,</span>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Peter Nguyen and I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to read my page! I am currently an Executive of CSESoc as the 2019 Arc Delegate and right now pursuing the next level of leadership by running as the Co-President of CSESoc for 2020. I am a penultimate student studying Computer Science.&nbsp;</span></p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been a part of the CSESoc community since my first year at the University of New South Wales in 2015 and after three years abroad, including two years studying in the United States at the University of South Florida, I have been active again at CSESoc events since 2018 upon returning back to Australia where it is my greatest intention to give back to the CSESoc community that has warmly welcomed me back and provided me a home at UNSW.&nbsp;</span></p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been proud to have been part of the 2019 CSESoc Leadership Team where it has been such a great a great honour to have grown so whilst also supporting and seeing our fellow very dedicated Execs, Directors and our Sub-Committee members grow so much throughout working endlessly on countless awesome initiatives and events for hundred of you all that attend regularly and seem to enjoy and benefit from a lot! And it has been a pleasure to have met hundreds of CSE students throughout the year that I hope to get to know more on a personal basis :)</span></p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it is my greatest passion to use my role to give back even further and help CSE students and other students who come to our events to feel welcome and at home when coming to many of our initiatives and free events. I sincerely hope that you all, our members&nbsp; will keep gaining increasing more value from our events and initiatives that we host whilst I hope that CSESoc will be able to continue helping our members make the most out of their University experience helping and aim to take that to the next level as we enter 2020!</span>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we delve further into this page, let us end this introduction with a poem that I wrote for one of CSESoc&rsquo;s new initiatives, brilliantly launched by our Marketing Portfolio, which I hope will set the tone for our community for the following year if I get elected as Co-President:</span></p>

					<h2>Experience</h2>
				</header>
				<section style="text-align:left">
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been blessed to have had many leadership roles before running for Co-President where I intended to use these invaluable experiences to help CSESoc grow even further and reach its fullest potential as one of the leading Arc Students Constituents Societies and become one of the best and most renowned societies at UNSW!</span></p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My involvement in CSESoc consists of being:</span></p>
					<h3><em>CSESoc Executive - Arc Delegate 2019</em></h3>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My job whilst on the CSESoc executive team was ensuring that through the activities of the Society&rsquo;s working groups, CSESoc&rsquo;s aims are being fulfilled. I also helped oversee and assisted the Directors in Careers, Marketing and Media, Social and Development Portfolios in setting up, running, and packing up their multiple initiatives events that included but limited too:</span></p>
					<ul>
					<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekly BBQs</span></li>
					<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional Development Courses</span></li>
					<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech Networking Night</span></li>
					<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Movie Night</span></li>
					<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annual Hackathon</span></li>
					<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding Competition</span></li>
					</ul>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mainly helped liaised and obtain the maximum funding of $4000 from Arc in their Activity Grants (that required Arc Forms be filled out at CSESoc events) by the end of Trimester 2 through documening and keeping records of all CSESoc&rsquo;s activities and events throughout the year. I also obtained an $4800 extra funding from Arc through 3 Student Development and Community Grants (SCDG) for both 2018 and 2019 Hackathons, First Year Camp (whilst still waiting for Arc&rsquo;s approval for an extra $2000 for CompClub&rsquo;s Rural Outreach Trip) with our income from Arc Totalling $8800. Whilst being Arc Delegate, I was involved with planning and running the CSESoc's Orientation Week back in Trimester 1 and was a Camp Leader at CSESoc&rsquo;s First Year Camp in 2019!</span></p>

					<h3><em><strong>Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) - Chapter President 2016-2017</strong></em></h3>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of the founding members of the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) Chapter at the University of South Florida officialised in Spring 2016, I oversaw meetings with officers of the Executive Board to plan and organise events for the Chapter. I coordinated communications between the Regional Managers and the University of the South Florida and facilitated events to help develop the professionalism, academic and networking skills of our members. Increased chapter membership by over 120% with over 200 members by the end of my Term, laying the foundations to reach the standards for the South Regional Team to select my Chapter to host the 2017 Southeast Regional Conference at my Chapter, one of the proudest moments of my life in leadership before CSESoc!</span></p>

					<h2>Vision and Policies</h2>
				</header>
				
				<section style="text-align: left;">
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CSESoc has provided a strong community holistic for hundreds of students at the University of New South Wales, not only students who study a Computer Science and Engineering Degree, but other students from other degrees primarily from the other STEM degrees. I have been very pleased yet humbled to hear that many non-CSE students especially those who study COMP courses have made decisions to transfer into a CSE Degree not only due to their enjoyment in COMP courses that they are taking, but due to strong and welcoming community that keeps them coming back to attend our quality, consistently regular events. This cannot be further from the truth with our current Directors, Sub-Committee members and other students being attracted to CSESoc, taking on leadership roles within the society having transferred into Computer Science and Engineering, thus becoming CSESoc members.</span></p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on my values leading CSESoc to help enrich, develop and positively influence our members and students studying other degrees, I would like to keep the quality and consistency of our events that up to hundreds of our members attend to, but I would like to keep expanding the reach of CSESoc to other CSE students who don&rsquo;t attend our events to attract more of them and welcome them into our community whilst also providing more opportunities for everyone to be involved within CSESoc which is beneficial to the society, but more importantly, be beneficial to the students of all backgrounds. With every more growing diversity amongst students studying a CSE Degree, I would also like to expand CSESoc&rsquo;s presence throughout campus and expose CSE students to other communities at University to help one step at a time break the stigma involving CSE students to other non-CSE students and also foster a greater relationship with the greater UNSW community.</span></p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I ultimately would like for CSESoc to help properly build the foundations of every CSE students that aren&rsquo;t primarily taught in an academic setting to help them provide more opportunities for a future path that will be more readily available to them.</span></p>
					<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are how I will implement these vision for CSESoc to help:</span></h3>

					<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. CSESoc Volunteering Initiative</span></em></h3>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an initiative that I would like to see to help </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">enrich</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CSESoc member&rsquo;s volunteering experience for members who are not in Exec, Directors or Sub-Committee roles but still have an opportunity to be involved with the society in a valuable way. For Trimester 1, there will be opportunities to work with Directors of the Portfolio that you would like to be part of the Sub-Committee for where you will have a chance to shadow them during the term (e.g. If you want to join Social subcom, you will have a chance to help setup and pack up the weekly BBQ) until you the interviewing process is finalised and the members of the respective subcom are announced.&nbsp;</span></p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, I am intending to make official the opportunity for students to up to 30 minutes before and after any CSESoc event to help setup and pack up and event where the Directors and Sub-Committee members already assigned to the event will also greatly appreciate your assistance as it was the case especially with CSESoc BBQ before Sub-Committees were introduced back in 2018! This I sincerely hope will foster a greater sense of service and community within CSESoc :)</span></p>
					<a class="image featured"><img src="images/BBQ.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<br />
					<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Coding Interview Preparation Series</span></em></h3>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will be a weekly series to help CSE students </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their coding interview skills as I feel that many students myself are often inadequately prepared for technical interviews which is crucial as it is the major hurdle that often prevents people from obtaining their Internships/Industrial Experience or their Graduate Role.</span></p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I am intending that this series will be either Directors/Experienced volunteers has had extensive experience with Technical Interview will go over examples of coding questions and how to approach and answer it, or be a weekly event where CSE students can gather and work together in the Seminar Room working in pairs or groups to go over coding questions together either from Cracking the Coding Interview, Hackerank or LeetCode. I intend for this series to run in Trimester 1 and 2 where the majority of interviews and hirings take place.</span></p>
					<a class="image featured"><img src="images/Workshop.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<br />
					<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. 21st Century Computer Science and Engineering Conference</span></em></h3>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will be the most ambitious endeavour yet which was not seen before at CSESoc in recent years. But since next will be 2020, I want to host our inaugural CSESoc hosted, three-day conference (like the Grace Hopper Conference for Women in Computing in the United States) which will cover Computer Science and Engineering in the 21st Century from Thursday to Saturday here at UNSW in the John Niland Scientia Building or a conference hotel located in the city.&nbsp;</span></p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would love to have this be a nationwide conference where students studying CSE in Universities around Sydney, throughout Australia and New Zealand, as well as other companies to fly into attend this three day conference. I would like to have the conference cover universal issues regarding Computer Science and Engineering, but I also would like to have options for streams available including but not limited to:&nbsp;</span></p>
					<ul>
					<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence</span></li>
					<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyber-Security</span></li>
					<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Science</span></li>
					<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human-Computer Interaction</span></li>
					<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet of Things</span></li>
					<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open Source</span></li>
					</ul>
					<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&rsquo;ll be over dozens of workshops and panels that will be hosted throughout the weekend by our sponsors and potential other representative from the Tech Industry. There&rsquo;ll also be more intimate and casual networking sessions on Thursday and Friday evenings and I plan to have a major career fair on the Sunday after an officiating ceremony to conclude the conference followed by celebrations. This is an ambitious endeavour I like to see happen here at UNSW having been to a few amazing huge scale nationwide conferences in the United States. So there will be great extensive opportunities to you and other members from CSESoc volunteer to become a part of the planning and organisation of the new endeavour I would like to see happen in Trimester 3 next year! Though whether this initiative will happen will depend entirely on your vote XD</span></p>
